# PTDDTOR - Projects that dont deserve their own repos
Every day i ask myself, where on Gods greeen earth i Have put this project. This repo is an equivalent to my top wardrobe shelf. 
I open it once a year, get what I want, then leave it for another year. 
You are not getting any fancy HTML fonts and formats because that is how much I dont care about this repo.
Enjoy!
