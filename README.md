# PTDDTOR - Projects that dont deserve their own repos
Every day i ask myself, where on Gods greeen earth i Have put this project. This repo i an equivalent to my top wardrobe shelf. 
I open it once a year, get what I want, then leave it for another year. 
You are not getting nice HTML fonts and formates because that is how much i dont care about this repo.
Enjoy!
